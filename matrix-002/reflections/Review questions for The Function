Review questions for The Function

What does the notation f:A⟶B mean?
	it means there is a function f with inputs mapping fromt domain set A to the codomain set B

What are the criteria for f to be an invertible function?
	for every input to a function f(x)->y its inverse f(y) should equal x

What is associativity of functional composition?
	(h∘g)∘f=h∘(g∘f)

What are the criteria for a function to be a probability function?
	A probability function is a function which assigns probabilities to the values of a random variable.
		All the probabilities must be between 0 and 1
		The sum of the probabilities must equal 1

What is the Fundamental Principle of Probability Theory?
	If two choices are to be made, with A ways to make the first choice and B ways to make the second choice, then there are A x B ways to make the two choices.


If the input to an invertible function is chosen randomly according to the uniform distribution, what is the distribution of the output?
